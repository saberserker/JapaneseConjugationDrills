Japanese Conjugation Drills

This is a Japanese conjugation quiz app made back in 2014. The particular itch I wanted to scratch was a combination of my
love for the Japanese language and for developing awesome iOS apps.
I am releasing the source code to it now in March 2016 so that I can share my insights and mistakes.
